This is a combination of my own research and elena's notes in with slack.
Created this because I wanted to learn more about league of legends

____


We are only going to 


There are 161 champions in total.

There are 150 items in LoL, and champions can buy and use nearly all items.


### Item Exceptions


### Enemies
target stats matter when calculating the damage output - mainly armor, magic resist and health)


### Calculations

There are different damage types. If we are dealing physical damage we only care about the targetÂ´s armor value, same for magic damage and magic resist. True damage does not care about any resistance so it always deal the same damage regardless of target (the easiest to calculate)

#### Abilities
 a good way to think about the abilities for this project is to think about them as formulas, this formulas have multiple variables. For example if an ability deals more damage the more AD and AP a champion has then we say the ability "scales" with AD and AP with AD and AP being variables in the formula.
