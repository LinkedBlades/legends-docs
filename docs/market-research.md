### TODO
In my opinion most of the graphs take up too much space and can be recreated to show the same data in a condensed version.

## Skill

This data on the player's skills:
the ratio of beginner players to professional / experienced players. 

How 


- we dont need to provide game specific knowledge in our "walkthrough" feature of our app, as only x amount of players have 1% of experience.

## Community

@import "assets/surveys/11501/friends.png"


Community influences:
how effective a marketing strategy will be that focuses on people sharing with friends. (10% off recommend a friend). 
If none are sharing with friends, a promotion like this will be pointless.

should we prioritise building features that allow sharing into the app?


## Player Exclusivity
these metrics measure how dedicated a typical player is to league of legends.

a fully dedicated player plays league of legends and no other games.

## Demographics Summary



## Surveyers Summarry



## Game Health

Game Health determines if 
some games have drastically reduced in popularity over the last few years (WOW).

As the amount of users of our application will be dependant on how many users are playing the game, looking at the projected future of the game is important.

(We dont want to develop an app for a game that is about to be closed)

These metrics quantify game health (get metricsfor this):

- historic profits

## Advertising / Marketing Strategy


By researching into the 
This data can be used when first advertising and placing ads, and in SEO, after the app has been developed, to more precisely target

For example, run facebook ads to bring in more users of the app to this targetted demographic.

- show here how many people spend money on the game
- are league of legends profits dropping, will the game go away soon.

as most players play on NA servers, and 41% of players are located in America, it makes sense to focus future advertising efforts in NA.




## Monetisation Strategy
to recoup the costs of the development of the project, we can monetise the completed version of the app in 2 different ways:


paid recurring monthly subscription - subscription does not display ads
free to use, displaying ads


show expected market traffic
show how much people spend

We will not be monetising the app, but we wanted to know if this was a viable option for the app...
