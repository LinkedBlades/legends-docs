#### Freddie Notes
I discovered these surveys by going to [league of legends reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends), searching "survey", sorting by past year.

You can also filter this information by Region. Here is the website : https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution
Also I found this article with more generic stats that may be useful https://activeplayer.io/league-of-legends/


### TODO
In my opinion most of the graphs take up too much space and can be recreated to show the same data in a condensed version.

## Player & User Skill

This data on the player's skills:
the ratio of beginner players to professional / experienced players. 




- we dont need to provide game specific knowledge in our "walkthrough" feature of our app, as only x amount of players have 1% of experience.

## Community

Community influences:
how effective a marketing strategy will be that focuses on people sharing with friends. (10% off recommend a friend). 
If none are sharing with friends, a promotion like this will be pointless.

should we prioritise building features that allow sharing into the app?


## Player Exclusivity
these metrics measure how dedicated a typical player is to league of legends.

a fully dedicated player plays league of legends and no other games.

## Demographics Summary



## Surveyers Summarry



## Game Health

get historic player count metrics and profits

Game Health determines if 
some games have drastically reduced in popularity over the last few years (WOW).

As the amount of users of our application will be dependant on how many users are playing the game, looking at the projected future of the game is important.

(We dont want to develop an app for a game that is about to be closed)

These metrics quantify game health (get metricsfor this):

- historic profits

#### How optimistic are you about the future of League of Legends?

## Advertising / Marketing Strategy


By researching into the 
This data can be used when first advertising and placing ads, and in SEO, after the app has been developed, to more precisely target

For example, run facebook ads to bring in more users of the app to this targetted demographic.

- show here how many people spend money on the game
- are league of legends profits dropping, will the game go away soon.

as most players play on NA servers, and 41% of players are located in America, it makes sense to focus future advertising efforts in NA.




## Monetisation Strategy
to recoup the costs of the development of the project, we can monetise the completed version of the app in 2 different ways:


paid recurring monthly subscription - subscription does not display ads
free to use, displaying ads


show expected market traffic on similar league tool utility build websites
show how much people spend

We will not be monetising the app, but we wanted to know if this was a viable option for the app...

how our app compares from riot games practice tool


write about this:
Yes,  most of the websites I mentioned before do take data from live games and give recommendations to players as they start the game or during game.  This functionality is cool but outside the scope of this project. The main idea for our project would be for players to use outside of the game in order to plan out their items before they are actually inside the game.

Our app are different to the websites above..list differences..

Not even think about calculations. Even though there is a recommendation section for which items it is better to buy for your champion, it is mainly made for beginners and it is based on the statistics (which items most players usually buy) and not on calculations (that we are going to make). So, the recommendation are okay but not the best.

there are few websites like u.gg but what they track is statistics regarding the game such as how popular a character is, how most people equip such character, how much that character is winning or losing currently compared to other characters, etc.
What we are doing is essentially a calculator, this functionality is not in any of the websites like u.gg, lolalytics.com or porofessor.gg to name a few
