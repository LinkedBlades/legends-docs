My proposal for our next meeting (19th Nov):
Pablo will walk us through the first prototype
We will assign somebody to make a good prototype in any tool, for example, Figma
We will brainstorm the questions for the questionnaire and assign someone to create the questionnaire and to send it.
I will show what I wrote for the section “Scope” for our report.
We will choose one more section from the report and will assign it to someone to make.
Freddie will walk us through the main points on the documentation repo

Example of meeting notes:
This meeting managed to: 
1. Review what the team had done so far. 
2. Discuss the current situation and decide on the next steps 
3. Decide who is doing what.
4. Set clear action points so that everyone knows what they’re doing by when and it was all within the space of 
1 hour.
5. In the next meeting the group would allocate time to discussing the market analyses, giving feedback, and 
deciding whether more work was needed or if the team could move on to the next stage. Notice that the 
team members were working to their strengths -- Sarah might be good at summarising and have good 
written English, while the team members doing market analyses might know a bit about the market they will 
be analysing. Speaking other languages is a particular bonus - it is much easier to analyse the Indonesian 
market if you can understand local publications rather than relying on international information in English.
