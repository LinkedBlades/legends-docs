<p>Other data:</p>
<p>Pablo: You can also filter this information by Region. Here is the
website : https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution</p>
<p>Also I found this article with more generic stats that may be useful
https://activeplayer.io/league-of-legends/</p>
<h3 id="todo">TODO</h3>
<p>In my opinion most of the graphs take up too much space and can be
recreated to show the same data in a condensed version.</p>
<h4 id="2022-survey-list">2022 Survey List</h4>
<h3 id="-report-below-here-">========== REPORT BELOW HERE =========</h3>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="survey-data-processing">Survey Data Processing</h3>
<p>The posted surveys were heavily compressed and hard to read once
added to the pdf, therefore the graphs have been manually reconstructed
in jupyter / matplotlib and exported.</p>
<p>Because of this, all values shown on the Y axis of the bar charts (X
axis for horizontal bar charts) are within 0-1% of the original data
values.</p>
<h3 id="survey-bias">Survey Bias</h3>
<p>Figure X shows hows this survey has bias towards experienced players,
due to the participants all being members of the League of Legends
Reddit forum.</p>
<p>This is due to a time period whereby a player has started playing but
hasn’t discovered the reddit forum yet, meaning less beginner players
will be included in these results.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Riot Games does not publish this data without it…</p>

<p>This data on the player’s skills: the ratio of beginner players to
professional / experienced players.</p>
<ul>
<li>we dont need to provide game specific knowledge in our “walkthrough”
feature of our app, as only x amount of players have 1% of
experience.</li>

<p>Figure X shows when most league of legends players started playing 10
years ago, and new players have gradually decreased since then.</p>

week, with only 12% playing more than 5 games a day (2 hours
playtime)</p>

<p>Community influences: how effective a marketing strategy will be that
focuses on people sharing with friends. (10% off recommend a friend). If
none are sharing with friends, a promotion like this will be
pointless.</p>
<p>should we prioritise building features that allow sharing into the
app?</p>
<h2 id="player-exclusivity">Player Exclusivity</h2>
<p>these metrics measure how dedicated a typical player is to league of
legends.</p>
<p>a fully dedicated player plays league of legends and no other
games.</p>
<p>(add more metrics here) -</p>
<p>Figure X shows almost 50% of League of Legends players do not play
any other games from Riot.</p>

more likely</p>

<h3 id="platform-considerations">Platform Considerations</h3>
<p>This means we will have to provide an interface that works well on
these alternate platforms to cover all these possible scenarios:</p>
<p>For players playing on Playstation, Nintendo Switch, they might use
our app through the web browser running on the console (this defaults to
the desktop version of responsive websites, and so will be using the
desktop interface layout).</p>
<p>For players playing on Mobile, they will use our app with the mobile
interface layout.</p>
<p>For players playing on PC, they will use our app with the desktop
interface layout.</p>

<p>Despite not playing as much, people still enjoy it very much.</p>
<p>Figure X shows players, when players were asked how much they agreed
with the statement “I enjoy playing League” on a scale from 1-10, two
thirds answered with 7 or higher. Only 4% said 1. At the same time,
players enjoy playing League now more than a few years ago.</p>
<p>Most users either enjoy it only slightly or a lot more, while the
overall agreement is marginally positive with an average score of
5.2.</p>

<h2 id="advertising--marketing-strategy">Advertising / Marketing
Strategy</h2>
<p>By researching into the This data can be used when first advertising
and placing ads, and in SEO, after the app has been developed, to more
precisely target</p>
<p>For example, run facebook ads to bring in more users of the app to
this targetted demographic.</p>
<ul>
<li>show here how many people spend money on the game</li>
<li>are league of legends profits dropping, will the game go away
soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>as most players play on NA servers, and 41% of players are located in
America, it makes sense to focus future advertising efforts in NA.</p>
<p>Figure X shows League of Legends engagement across social media
platforms.</p>
<p>If running paid ads or campaigns on social media platforms. Twitter
and Discord will be the best platforms to start.</p>

<h2 id="monetisation-strategy">Monetisation Strategy</h2>
<p>to recoup the costs of the development of the project, we can
monetise the completed version of the app in 2 different ways:</p>
<p>paid recurring monthly subscription - subscription does not display
ads free to use, displaying ads</p>
<p>show expected market traffic on similar league tool utility build
websites show how much people spend</p>
<p>We will not be monetising the app, but we wanted to know if this was
a viable option for the app…</p>
<p>around 60% of players have spent more than 100</p>
<p>If we charged, th</p>
<p>This really shows the profitability of free to play games such as
League of Legends.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning is that League of Legends</p>
<p>. So providing that actually provides a competitive advantage to</p>
