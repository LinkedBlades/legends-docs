# Project Planning


freddie from slack:

we use issue labels (tags) to link low level goals to high level goals (For example an issue named "Create Frontend Mockup" to "Midterm"), if this this has to be done before the midterm.
we can assign ourselves or each other to a task by adding them as an assignee to the issue.
we use markdown syntax in github issues to make our task / goal specifications presentable, so they can be added to the report showing how we have managed the project.
We can write the report in markdown and store it in the repo. In plain text, so it can be tracked by version control. (no .docx etc)
This means adding incrementally to the report is easier, all written material is in the same format, and all of us can edit it.
Some benefits to this management approach:
we dont have to learn a new software such as content management system, jira.
edits to source files can be tracked within our management notes for that task. in jira, this would have to be implemented with a jira "github" plugin, more setup..
keeps everything in 1 place in the repo, and keeps things simple.
we can link to PRs, parts of the source code easier.
